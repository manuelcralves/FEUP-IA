# IA Project 2
  
## CPD Projects of group ------
  
Group members:
  
1. Manuel Amorim (up202007485)
2. Tom√°s Maciel (up202006845)
3. Manuel Alves (up201906910)

## How to run
  
In terminal (in project folder):
python main.py
  
... and wait (may take 1 or 2 minutes)
  
The main function already calls every one of the algorithms and in the end shows all the metrics in a table and in a graph. 

To see more graphs that were generated while the code was being developed by the students, it it necessary to turn true the "log" parameters in each function (when it exists).
